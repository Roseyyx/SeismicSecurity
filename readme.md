A new password manager that automatically updates ur passwords online.

Still a W.I.P.

It can be hosted or used on:
    - Docker
    - Web extension
    - Desktop app
    - Mobile app

Please note that fully automated password updates only works on self hosted instances on Docker.
For the extension, desktop and mobile app you will be reminded every configured amount of days. The password updating will still be done automatically.
